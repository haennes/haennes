## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Things I am working on
- Getting Better at [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
- Having to much fun while configuring my systems:
  - [a solution](https://github.com/haennes/wireguard-wrapper.nix) for wireguard that somewhat scales even though it doesn't need to
  - [same thing](https://github.com/haennes/syncthing-wrapper.nix) for syncthing
  - [same thing](https://github.com/haennes/IPorts.nix) for ips, ports and mac addresses
- [Automating transcribing speech](https://github.com/haennes/signal-whisper) notes recieved over [Signal](https://github.com/signalapp)
#### Why should I use Nix
- scales great (lets ignore my eval time of 1 Minute because my flake is quite complicated)
- dont backup your os, just rollback or deploy again
- spin up or migrate to a new server in just minutes
- have the same setup on all your pcs
- because you already started and you got an unhealthy obsession for declarativity and configurability
- you like spending 10h automating something that could be done in 1h manually (oh wait, thats my motto of life :rofl:)


### Things I am curious about
- Computers
- Maths
- Physics & Space
